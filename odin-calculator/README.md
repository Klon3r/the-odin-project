# The Odin Project: Calculator
This is my version of the calculator project

I learned alot after finishing this project.
- I should have created more variables like (let var = text.innerText) this would have saved my typing it out every time.
- Make more functions to reduce the amount of code I am writing

Below is a screenshot of the project:
